\section{Introduction}

Software versioning is a convention to keep track of a software product as it goes through its life cycle, from development to deployment and from production to sustainment\cite{Wikipedia_software_version_short}.

In general, versions are unique for every state of the software and follow a sequence to indicate the nature of the change from one state to the next.

Versioning is required for consistency and to facilitate teamwork around writing, building, testing, deploying, selling, and maintaining the product. 


Complex software is made up of multiple inter-operating components. 
An extreme case is a micro-services architecture with the system composed of independent and specialized pieces designed to interact in order to complete a complex task.

The version of the finished product is important for everyone involved. 
The version of the individual components is more important for the developers, testers, and maintainers of the product.

Component version resolution is addressed during the build process.
The most common strategy is to have a component know the minimum (latest) version of the other components it needs. 
It is also possible to have each component know the list of others that depend on it.

    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        rnode/.style={rectangle, draw=blue!60!white, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=7mm}, 
        node distance=4.5cm,
        ->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto
    ]
        \node[rnode] (A) {SmrtHVRService};
        \node[rnode] (B) [above of=A] {HVRLib};
        \node[rnode] (C) [above left of= A]{DbService};
        \node[rnode] (D) [above right of=A] {Notifications};

        \path (A) edge node {1.2.234} (B)
            (A) edge [bend left] node {3.1.16} (C)
            (A) edge [bend right] node {1.1.34} (D);
    \end{tikzpicture}

The most widely used system is semantic versioning \cite{Wikipedia_software_version}.
It has three parts: major.minor.patch.
